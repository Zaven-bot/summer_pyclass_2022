## manoatemp.py
Write a python program that converts the current temperature of Manoa from Fahrenheit to Celsius AND Celsius to Fahrenheit.
Assign the temperature (in Fahrenheit) to a variable. Use that variable as a part of the calculation.
Give both results to the tenths’ place.
Print the result within the statement provided in specifications.

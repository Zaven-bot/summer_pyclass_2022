## manoatemp.py
Write a python program that converts the current temperature of Manoa from Fahrenheit to Celsius AND Celsius to Fahrenheit.
Assign the temperature (in Fahrenheit) to a variable. Use that variable as a part of the calculation.
Give both results to the tenths’ place.
Print the result within the statement provided in specifications.
  
  
### Main Concepts:
* Commenting
* Spacing
* Cascading code
* Independent testing
* Algebra in python
* Standard output in python


### Specifications: 
Variable      | Ouput
------------- | -------------
78 (℉)        | The temperature is 78 degrees Fahrenheit in Manoa right now. This is 25.5 degrees Celsius.
-25.5 (℉)     | The temperature is -25.5 degrees Fahrenheit in Manoa right now. This is -31.6 degrees Celsius.
0 (℉)         | The temperature is 0 degrees Fahrenheit in Manoa right now. This is -17.7 degrees Celsius.
0 (℃)         | The temperature is 0 degrees Celsius in Manoa right now. This is 32 degrees Fahrenheit.
-25 (℉)       | The temperature is -25 degrees Celsius in Manoa right now. This is -13 degrees Fahrenheit.
78 (℃)        | The temperature is 78 degrees Celsius in Manoa right now. This is 172.4 degrees Fahreneheit.

## sum.py
Write a python program that takes a variable x, and calculates x + xx + xxx. You only need to consider “x” integer values with two digits or less.


### Main Concepts:
* Commenting
* Spacing
* Cascading code
* Independent testing

# Day 1 Pseudocode


## Problem 1 Pseudocode Steps:
**PURPOSE:** receive 2 directional inputs from the programmer to calculate the total distance Katie traveled with the distance formula
* Store "North" value
* Store "East" value
* Put both values into the distance formula
* Print distance formula result to user


## Problem 2 Pseudocode Steps:
**Purpose:** receive 2 directional inputs from the programmer to print to the user the total distance Tyler traveled. Calculate the total distance Tyler traveled with the distance formula and the conversion equation.
* Store "South" value
* Store "West" value
* Put both values into distance formula
* Convert distance formula result into miles
* Print distance formula result to user


## Problem 3 Pseudocode Steps:
**Purpose:** receive 4 directional inputs from the programmer to print to the user the total distance Tayler traveled. Calculate the total distance Tayler traveled with the distance formula.
* Store the 1st x value
* Store the 2nd x value
* Store the 1st y value
* Store the 2nd y value
* Calculate the shortest distance from the first coordinate to the second coordinate using the distance formula
* Print distance formula result to user

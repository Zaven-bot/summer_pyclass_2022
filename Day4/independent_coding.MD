# Independent Coding Project 6

## flights.py
Write a python program that can determine the total time of travel by a traveler. This plane travel will have a layover as well, determine the total 
layover time. Both the departure and arrival times will be in military time. 


You can expect:
* That the trip will be taken throughout a single day (e.g., will NOT go from 23 00 to 1 00)
* That the user will type in only valid military times (i.e., no negatives, will put in the correct amount of values prompted)


### Main Concepts:
* Commenting
* Spacing
* Cascading code
* Independent testing
* Algebra in python
* Functions
* Indexing
* Lists
* Print statements
* split()


### Specification(s): How your output/input should look like

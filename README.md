# summer_pyclass_2022

This project was made for use alongside TORCH during July-August 2022. 
This project will be used by Ian Unebasami and Calista Agmata for helping students who attend their Python workshop during July-August 2022. 
It includes independent labs for students to implement on their own to practice many coding concepts (e.g., algebraic operators, logical operators, etc.). 
If you would like to get started with the project, you must read the CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md first and then receive permission from either Ian or Calista to implement them.
Ian Unebasami and Calista Agmata are the main contributers who will maintain this project.

# Independent Coding Project 2

## countdigits.py
Write a python program that can determine how many digits are in a number that the user provides. Determine if the number is negative. Accept floats.
Edge Case #1: If the user puts anything other than an integer, relay the new number to be evaluated.
* 129.4 = 129
* 129.6 = 129

### Main Concepts:
* Commenting
* Spacing
* Cascading code
* Independent testing
* Algebra in python
* Conditional statements

### Specification(s):

Variable      | Ouput
------------- | -------------
293817239     | User entered 293817239.(new line)The number, 293817239, has three or more digits.
-298.23       | User entered -298.23. Number was truncated to -298.(new line)The number -298 has three or more digits. The number -298 is negative.
30            | User entered 30.(new line)The number 30 has two digits.
-21.00        | User entered -21.(new line)The number -21 has two digits. The number is negative.
7             | User entered 7.(new line)The number 7 has one digit.
-3            | User entered -3.(new line)The number -3 has one digit. The number is negative.

## sum.py
Write a python program that takes a variable x, and calculates x + xx + xxx. You only need to consider “x” integer values with two digits or less.


### Main Concepts:
* Commenting
* Spacing
* Cascading code
* Independent testing
* Algebra in python
* Standard output in python


### Specifications:

Variable      | Ouput
------------- | -------------
0             | Your sum is 0.
10            | Your sum is 102030. 
4             | Your sum is 492.
